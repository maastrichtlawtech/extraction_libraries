# Structure

- There are dedicated branches for each of the extraction libraries. Rechtspraak is under the `rechtspraak` branch, ECHR under `echr`, and CELLAR under `cellar`.
- This is temporary and the branches will be moved to their individual repositories in a while after which this repository will be archived.
- For navigating each of these libraries, just select the appropriate branch and their sub branches.
